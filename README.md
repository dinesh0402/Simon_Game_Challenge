# Simon_Game_Challenge
## This is a basic Simon Game (Game of Memory)

This is a challenge which I did as a part of a Web Development Bootcamp program.

### For those of you who don't know what the Simon Game is ....? ðŸ‘‡
* It's basically a game of remembering the patterns of colors as far as you can.
* You will be given 4 colors (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green).
* These colors will pop up on a random basis.
* All you need to do is to remember the pattern in which the pattern of color pop-ups.

For Example., If the first color that pops-up is "Red", then the current pattern is [Red]. Let's say the next color is "Blue", then the pattern becomes [Red,Blue]. Then if "Green" comes, the pattern becomes [Red,Blue,Green]. If later again red comes, the pattern becomes [Red,Blue,Green,Red] and so on.
If you get this pattern wrong, then its **"GAME OVER"** and the games gets reset.
